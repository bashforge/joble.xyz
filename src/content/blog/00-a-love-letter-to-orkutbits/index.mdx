## The Golden Era of Scrapbooks

Before the polished feeds of today, there was Orkut. It was a space that felt alive, raw, and full of personality. If you were online back then, you remember the "Scrapbook" — it was the heart of our digital social lives. It was where we shared jokes, life updates, and birthday wishes with friends across the globe.

I noticed something back then. While Orkut was revolutionary, it was visually a bit plain. However, it had one beautiful quirk: it allowed basic HTML tags in posts. That was my "aha" moment. I realized that if I could give people a simple way to express their emotions through color and design, I could help them make those digital interactions feel a little more human.

### Enter OrkutBits

That spark of an idea became **OrkutBits**. 

I began designing and organizing custom graphics and digital cards, categorizing them so people could find exactly what they needed. Whether it was a quiet "Thinking of You" or a vibrant "Happy Birthday," I wanted to provide a visual language for the things we often find hard to put into words.

The beauty was in the simplicity. I provided the HTML embed code right next to the graphic. All a user had to do was copy, paste, and suddenly, their friend's scrapbook was transformed.

### A Million Small Connections

What started as a creative project quickly turned into something much larger. I eventually added greeting cards for every occasion, realizing just how much people valued making their loved ones feel special.

Soon, OrkutBits wasn't just a local site. It was reaching people all over the world. At its peak, the service was receiving about **1 million hits per day**. 

It was a lesson in the power of solving a simple problem with a bit of heart and a lot of organization. I am still so proud that my work helped people celebrate their milestones and stay connected in a more colorful way.

### Preserving the Memory

Orkut eventually closed its doors, and OrkutBits went with it. While the live site is gone, the memories and the impact remain. It served as my foundation in the digital world, teaching me that at the end of the day, technology is best used when it brings people closer together.

If you’re feeling a bit nostalgic, you can still see a piece of that history. A cached version of OrkutBits lives on in the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20100729202224/http://www.orkutbits.com/).

Looking back at those graphics today, they represent more than just pixels on a screen. They represent the first time I realized I could create something that truly mattered to people.
